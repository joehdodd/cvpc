			<h2>What We Believe</h2>
			<p>Chattanooga Valley PCA is a gathering of sin-sick people being washed clean and made new by the glorious and powerful grace of God in Jesus.</p>
			<p>CVPC was born in 1949 out of the conviction that the Word of God is the clear, sufficient, inerrant and so authoritative word of God and record of his mighty work of grace to restore all things by Jesus.  CVPC is a member congregation of the Tennessee Valley Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA).</p>

			<h2>How We Worship</h2>
			<p>The privilege to gather without fear but with rejoicing in the presence of the Holy God to Worship is a gift and a command. It is a gift because by it we behold the glories of our Father's grace on display in the person of Jesus and continuing to work by His Spirit.</p>
			<p>It is a command because by it we glorify our Father who is in heaven and so live and become agents of life in a world of death, quite literally making visible on earth the wonders of his heavenly Kingdom and his glorious King.  For this reason, we seek to be Father-glorifying, Christ-centered, Spirit-guided, and Lifestyle-forming in our worship.</p>
